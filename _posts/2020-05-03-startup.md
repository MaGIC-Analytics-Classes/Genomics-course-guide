# Welcome!
This course is being developed as of May 2020. Anyone who wishes to help is more than welcome to (though the only person who may ever read this is me). The Bioinformatics of Genomics is meant to be a full scale course to introduce the basics and most standard applications within the Next Gen Sequencing (NGS) space. If this venture proves successful, we will hope to develop a Bioinformatics of Proteomics and Metabolomics as well- stay tuned!

Announcements for official class sessions will be posted here as well.
