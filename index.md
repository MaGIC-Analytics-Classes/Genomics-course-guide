## Welcome
Welcome to the Bioinformatics of Genomics Course! This has been an effort by the Molecular and Genomics Informatics Core to provide developing scientists introduction and growth opportunities into bioinformatics. 

### Class Structure
This course is designed to provide the background knowledge of Next Generation Sequencing, introduce you to the basics of computer science, walk into bioinformatics and then dive into the individual workflows. Each section will be broken down to include lectures as well as provide hands on training. 

For hands on training, all notebooks will be provided via GitHub and available to all. During course offerings, a Binderhub will be hosted to enable live execution.
