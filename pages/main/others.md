## Other sources of Online Resources
Fortunately, there are several very powerful resources out there by incredible groups to help learn bioinformatics. We would highly recommend exploring them as you go further down this path. This is also by no means a comprehensive list, so if you have another great resource please send it along and we can add it below. 

### Software Carpentry/ Data Carpentry
These two groups are now one large group, with Data Carpentry as a subset of Software Carpentry. Both are a collection of workshops that can be taken online or in person to help get through the basics of software applications or specific data workflows. 
#### Software Carpentry
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) has a few excellent workshops on learning Unix, R, and Python
#### Data Carpentry
[Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop) has workshops more geared towards Genomics for workflow introductions and specifically command line usage for genomics applications. 

### Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics
This is a great deep dive into the basics of bioinformatics provided by the [Caporaso lab](http://caporasolab.us/). It is primarily geared towards microbial research, but has excellent information on how many of the basic algorithms work.

### Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core
The [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](https://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/) has also built some very informative lessons for bioinformatics. Specifically, they have a full set of modules meant for either online learning or workshop settings.

### Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis
Run by Dr. Brown and Dr. Word from the University of California Davis, this bioinformatics workshop has been held for 10 years now. Beyond having an in-person workshop, they provide the curriculum online for later learning.

### Open Source Society University
This is probably the most intensive program, and is essentially a 4 year university program offered through a variety of online classes across different platforms.
